# Python Basics


Learning Python

This Course Goes along with https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw !

### Lesson 1 - Hello World

notes - Using "print" is similar to "puts" in ruby.

### Lesson 2 - Build A Shape

notes - Python reads its scripts line by line!


### Lesson 3 - Variables

notes -
Theres 3 Major types of data in Python

String Integers and Booleans

There's no need to declare new variables in Python. If we're talking about variables in functions or modules, no declaration is needed. Just assign a value to a name where you need it: mymagic = "Magic" . Variables in Python can hold values of any type, and you can't restrict that.

This is Similar to variables in Ruby.
However Unlike Ruby you cannot concact integers into strings you must first convert it into a string using
the str() function.

You can also reassign the variables in the same way as ruby simply change the value by setting it to a new value

mymagic = "Magic"

....

mymagic = "New Magic" Now the variable mymagic will out put "New Magic" from here on out.


### Lesson 4 - Strings


notes -

Strings are indexed starting at 0

you can use \n to make a new line

you can use \\ to put a backspace

you can use \" to put a quotation

You can chain multiple functions together like var.upper().isupper()

### Lesson 5 - Numbers

notes -

Overall numbers work the same as in all programming languages

Numbers can be whole or decimal,

You can convert numbers to strings using the str() function

You can handle math using the regular operator signs

You can set the order of operations using ()

There are many math functions that you can use on numbers such as pow, max

find a list of them here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html

### Lesson 6 - User Input

notes - 

Getting user info is very simple, you can use declare a variable and set it equal to 
the input() function and enter a prop,
then simply use the variable as you do all the other variables..
run the code to understand better.

to convert an input into a number you have to use the int() or float() function on the variable


### Lesson 7 - Lists

notes - 

Lists are a structure inside of python to store multiple data values, these are basically arrays in most other languages,

they are stored as ["a", 1, variable]

it can be a list of anything, it can be a list of lists etc,
the join function concacts them together,

you can select specific ranges by using the index numbers which start at 0

list[1:3], will only print out elements between the second and 4th element

### Lesson 8 - List Functions

notes -

We did some functions earlier with the "join()" but
in this lesson we will be diving further into list functions

### Lesson 9 - Tuples

notes -
