# Python Basics


Learning Python

This Course Goes along with https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw !

### Lesson 1 - Hello World

notes - Using "print" is similar to "puts" in ruby.

### Lesson 2 - Build A Shape

notes - Python reads its scripts line by line!


### Lesson 3 - Variables

notes -
Theres 3 Major types of data in Python

String Integers and Booleans

There's no need to declare new variables in Python. If we're talking about variables in functions or modules, no declaration is needed. Just assign a value to a name where you need it: mymagic = "Magic" . Variables in Python can hold values of any type, and you can't restrict that.

This is Similar to variables in Ruby.
However Unlike Ruby you cannot concact integers into strings you must first convert it into a string using
the str() function.

You can also reassign the variables in the same way as ruby simply change the value by setting it to a new value

mymagic = "Magic"

....

mymagic = "New Magic" Now the variable mymagic will out put "New Magic" from here on out.


### Lesson 4 - Strings


notes -

Strings are indexed starting at 0

you can use \n to make a new line

you can use \\ to put a backspace

you can use \" to put a quotation

You can chain multiple functions together like var.upper().isupper()

### Lesson 5 - Numbers

notes -

Overall numbers work the same as in all programming languages

Numbers can be whole or decimal,

You can convert numbers to strings using the str() function

You can handle math using the regular operator signs

You can set the order of operations using ()

There are many math functions that you can use on numbers such as pow, max
